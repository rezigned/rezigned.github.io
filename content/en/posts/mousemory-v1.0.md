Introducing [Mousemory](https://github.com/rezigned/Mousemory)! A simple macOS utility app that remembers your cursor positions across multiple monitors.

Since COVID-19 pandemic. Most people started working from home (including me). If you have a setup where you have more than 1 monitor. You might have felt like me.

When switching between monitors (via `cmd + tab`). I've to drag the cursor from previous screen to the new screen all the time (which can cause repetitive strain injury). Why can't it just remembers the previous position and then restore it when switching back?

So, I was searching for these kind of apps but couldn't find one. Then, I decided to make it myself. It's also a good chance for me to learn more about `Swift` + `macOS` development.
